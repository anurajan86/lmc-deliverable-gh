      'Atlanta, specifically, has an ecosystem that primarily consists of pine and deciduous forests, and the location has a wide variety of natural wonders, including rivers and green parks. Unfortunately, many of Atlanta’s natural wonders have been infested by invasive species and polluted or otherwise damaged by urban development. According to Georgia’s State Wildlife Action Plan, about 640 animal and plant species are listed as high priorities for conservation, and more than 105,000 acres of land are needed to take conservation and recreation. Also, based on data provided by the National Wildlife Federation, one-third of U.S. species are facing the risk of extinction, and over 1600 plants and animals are already under the Endangered Species Act. The serious situation faced by wildlife urges us to conserve species before they become endangered. However, why do we need to consume cherished resources to protect wildlife? How does wildlife affect our daily life? ',

      'Firstly, one of the reasons that animals and plants are suffering from the loss of habitations is  the increase of human populations and demands for resources. Without the turbulence of humans and industrialization, wildlife habitats won’t shrink so quickly and seriously. Animals and plants can still live prosperously and strongly.  Secondly, animals and plants play important roles to sustain the ecosystems of the earth. Without them, our environment will face the threats of natural disasters and end with extinction as time goes by. Thirdly, conserving populations of wildlife in Georgia before they become more endangered would save us many resources such as money and time. According to the national survey, American’s spent over $140 million dollars on the preservation of habitations, which is equal to 1% of the U.S. total gross domestic product. The sooner we protect the habitations, the more money we could save to do other stuff. \
      In the meanwhile, the unfortunate reality of many community-based environmental revitalization processes is that though they eventually improve living conditions, they also increase local real estate value and unwittingly drive out members due to prices being too high. We propose a different approach to environmental revitalization, which is asset-based. We take a community-based approach and play to the area’s strengths, identity, and natural resources. This neighboured approach could let us get feedback from different groups of minorities in the community. We can know their opinions and concerns so that we can conserve the habitations without damaging their interests and intensify the existing gentrification.',
